    "\n",
    "Suppose that $C$ is a class of structures axiomatized by a finite theory $T$. Suppose that $T'$ is a theory such that $T'$ also axiomatizes $C$ (i. e., $T$ coincides with the set of all and only those structures that satisfy $T'$). Show that there exists a finite subset of $T'$ that axiomatizes $C$.\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "$T$ a finite theory and $T$ axiomatizes $C$ implies that $C$ is finitelly axiomatizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there exist a sentence $E$ such that $E$ axiomatizes $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T'$ also axiomatizes $C$ then the sentence $E$ must be provable from theory $T'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there exist a formal derivation $(D_1 D_2 \\cdots D_n)$ of $T'$ with conclusion $E$. In other words, there exist a sequence of formulas $(F_1, \\cdots, F_n)$ such that $F_i$ is in $T'$ or can be obtained by Generalization or Modus Pones by the previous formulas. So there exist a finite subset of $T'$ such that implies $E$ then this finite subset axiomatizes $C$. ■"

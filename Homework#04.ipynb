    "Prove $T$ is $\\omega$-consistency $\\Rightarrow$ $T$ is consistent is equivalent to prove $T$ is inconsistent $\\Rightarrow$ $T$ is $\\omega$-inconsistency.\n",

But, by the Gödel's First Incompletness Theorem, Part I, if $T$ is consistent then $G$ is umprovable in $T$. Therefore, $T$ is inconsistent, contradiction. So, if $T$ is consistent then $T + \\{\\neg G\\}$ is consistent.\n",

So, by the theorem aforementioned, $\\neg G$ is not provable in $T + \\{\\neg G\\}$, but $T + \\{\\neg G\\}$ does prove $\\neg G$, contradiction.

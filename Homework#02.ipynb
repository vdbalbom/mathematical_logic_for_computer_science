    "\n",
    "Let the Spoiler play any $m$-moves game $(p_1, \\cdots, p_m)$ in $A_{n+1}$ and the Duplicator play any game $(q_1, \\cdots, q_m)$ in $A_n$.\n",

    "For any $p_i$ in $A_{n+1}$, $p_i$ is connected only to $v$ and $w$, also, for any $q_i$ in $A_n$, $q_i$ is connected only to $v$ and $w$, which means that the Duplicator wins.\n",

    "\n",
    "Also we can conclude that $\\mathfrak{B}_n \\equiv_n \\mathfrak{B}_{n+1}$. The duplicator just need to choose $v$ or $w$ in $\\mathfrak{B}_n$ if the Spoiler choose $v$ or $w$ in $\\mathfrak{B}_{n+1}$ or to choose $v$ or $w$ in $\\mathfrak{B}_{n+1}$ if the Spoiler choose $v$ or $w$ in $\\mathfrak{B}_{n}$.\n",

    "About the structure $\\mathfrak{B}_n$ we can say that $a_1, \\cdots, a_n$ have degree equal $2$ and $v, w$ have degree equal $n$. So, the structure $\\mathfrak{B}_n$ is Eulerian if and only if $n$ is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the property of being Eulerian can be expressed in the language of graphs and it has complexity equal $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know $\\mathfrak{B}_{2k}$ must have this property (because $2k$ is even). Also, as proved before, we have that $\\mathfrak{B}_{2k} \\equiv_{2k} \\mathfrak{B}_{2k + 1}$ (just make $n = 2k$). So $\\mathfrak{B}_{2k + 1}$ also have this property (because $k \\leq 2k$). But $\\mathfrak{B}_{2k + 1}$ is not Eulerian (because $2k + 1$ is odd), and here is the contradiction. \n",
